\subsubsection{Data Description}\label{data-description}

Two separate surveys were administered to mutually exclusive groups:
veterinary employers who have worked with students, and educators who
have taught those students. There was no overlap between these
groups---no evidence suggests that any surveyed student was both taught
by an educator and later employed by a participating employer.

The employer dataset consists of responses from 29 participants
answering 40 questions, while the educator dataset includes 43
participants answering 34 questions. Each group was asked a single
qualifying question to determine eligibility on participation and nine
questions which asked about the participants demographics or
institution. Educators were then given 24 questions, employers 30
questions, that were focused on DVM student compentencies and
professional sentiments regarding training in veterinarian medicine.

Survey questions can in several forms. There were binary Yes/No
responses; common among the demographic/institution questions. ``Select
all that apply'' responses which act as its names sake with no limit to
the number of selections. These were common in questions asking the
participant to select all from a list of medical precedures at a
practice. Many of these questions then were accompanied by Likert Scale
question. The Likert Scale data was even-degreed with no neutral
response. We believe the lack of a non-neutrality option caused at least
two participants to answer both ``agree'' and ``disagree'' to a survey
question. There were questions that offered an ``other'' response. For
these situations, the survey accomodated a text entry for the
participant to elaborate on selecting ``other''. Finally, there were
some questions which ask participants to put in an interger when asked
to give their account of a quantifiable value (i.e., hours worked,
number of accredited veterinarians, etc.). This interger was limitless
regardless of the questions' context.

Additionally, survey completion time differed between groups. Educators,
on average, spent more time completing the survey than employers. While
the survey did not ask participants to explain their response time, this
difference may reflect greater engagement or the tendency for more
elaborated responses among educators. These differences in response
count might also lend credence to greater willingness among educators to
engage with the survey. A box plot below illustrates the distribution of
survey duration (in minutes) by group.

\begin{center}
\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{Final-Project_files/figure-pdf/Data_Desc_01-1.pdf}}
\end{center}

Regarding the proportion of the survey completed, employer responses
were more variable---spanning the full range from partial to full
completion. In contrast, educators tended to complete more of the
survey, with a concentration near full completion and a less pronounced
left tail. The density plot below visualizes these differences in survey
progress across groups.

\begin{center}
\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{Final-Project_files/figure-pdf/Data_Desc_02-1.pdf}}
\end{center}

From the educators dataset we could talk about: * Q27; How long have you
been teaching DVM students in the clinical training portion of a DVM
program? * Q28; Does your institution have a teaching hospital? * Q29;
On average, how many dental procedures does your primary care service
perform each week?

From the employers dataset we could talk about: * Q33; Which of the
following best describes your job setting or organization? * Q36; On
average, how many dental procedures does your
practice/oganization/institution perform each week * Q37; Which of the
following best describes the person who completed this survey?

\subsubsection{Data Source}\label{data-source}

Survey data were collected using Qualtrics, a cloud-based experience
management platform commonly used for gathering feedback and sentiment
across workforce domains. Participants were recruited via email
invitation sent by the researcher, using pre-existing contact lists.
Participation was voluntary and anonymized.

\subsubsection{Preprocessing
Description}\label{preprocessing-description}

Although the employer and educator datasets shared a similar structure,
they were not identical. Most preprocessing steps were applied uniformly
across both datasets, with minor deviations where needed.

The datasets were imported into the RStudio environment (version
2024.04.1 Build 748). A new variable was created to label the data
source (``Educator'' or ``Employer'') for later grouping and
visualization. The existing respondent\_id column served as a unique
identifier and was treated as the primary key.

Initial cleaning involved removing extraneous metadata included by
Qualtrics---such as survey start and end times, IP addresses,
geolocation data, and question display logic---all of which were
irrelevant to the analysis. These columns were trimmed to streamline the
dataset for subsequent transformation and statistical work.

Column names in the original Qualtrics export were alphanumeric but
often ambiguous and misleading. Many variable names did not match the
corresponding survey question numbers. Our team manually mapped the
exported column names to their corresponding survey questions and
responses by referencing adjacent metadata fields and using deductive
reasoning. This process allowed us to build an index-based column naming
structure, which greatly improved the manageability and interpretability
of the dataset.

Before diving into question-specific analysis, we first identified the
subset of survey questions relevant to our research objectives. All
unrelated or out-of-scope items were removed. This step reduced the
employer dataset from 176 columns to 100, and the educator dataset from
171 columns to 102.

Several formatting inconsistencies also needed to be resolved. Some
multi-select questions appeared in the form of comma-separated text
responses within a single column, while others were exported into
multiple binary columns. Additionally, for certain questions, a response
option that received zero selections was dropped entirely by Qualtrics.
To standardize these issues, we implemented a script to ``explode''
comma-separated responses into individual binary columns. For dropped
columns, we manually reintroduced them as zero-filled dummy variables to
preserve the full response structure.

Finally, we filtered out participants who answered less than half of the
survey. We also excluded:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Employers who responded ``No'' to the question: ``Do you work with
  early career veterinarians (someone who has graduated from a DVM
  program after May 2021)?''
\item
  Educators who responded ``No'' to: ``Do you teach in any capacity of
  the dental curriculum at your institution?''
\end{itemize}

After all preprocessing steps, the final cleaned datasets consisted of
13 employer participants and 30 educator participants.

\paragraph{S5 Is there difference between the instructional formats in

employers to have been completed by early career
veterinarians?}\label{s5-is-there-difference-between-the-instructional-formats-in-dentistry-reported-by-dvm-programs-and-the-formats-perceived-by-employers-to-have-been-completed-by-early-career-veterinarians}

\paragraph{S6 Do educators and employers differ in their views on which
formats of clinical instruction in dentistry should be required for DVM
students as part of their clinical
training?}\label{s6-do-educators-and-employers-differ-in-their-views-on-which-formats-of-clinical-instruction-in-dentistry-should-be-required-for-dvm-students-as-part-of-their-clinical-training}

In question \#21 of the employers version of the survey, participants
were asked, ``Which of the following types of \emph{clinical instruction
in dentistry} do you think that DVM students should be required to
complete as part of a \emph{DVM program}? Select one response for each
of the instructional types listed below.'' The analogue of this question
for educators was survey question \#17. The educators survey question
had a slight variation in phraseology. It asked, ``Which of the
following types of \emph{instruction} do you think DVM students should
be required to complete as part of their \emph{clinical training}?
Select one response for each type of instruction listed below.''.

This question is targeting how participants feel about what dental
veterinarian medical programs are teaching and what topics should be
required in their curriculum. The research question asked if there was a
difference in opinions on this matter. To infer from the data, we will
use the Mann-Whitney U-Test, a non-parametric test also known as
Wilcoxin Rank Sign Test. This test assumes mutual exclusivity between
groups.
