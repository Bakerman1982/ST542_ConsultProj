Are there significant differences between educators and practice owners in their belief that new graduates are competent in key dental skills on their first day of practice?

First I'll combine the datasets and keep it to question 4 only
```{r}
library(dplyr)
   
# Add group identifiers
educator_cleaned <- Educator_Data_Clean %>%
  mutate(group = "Educator")

employer_cleaned <- Employer_Data_Clean %>%
  mutate(group = "Employer")

# Define Q4 variable names for both datasets
q4_vars <- paste0("Q04_", sprintf("%02d", 1:12))  # creates Q04_01 to Q04_12

# Subset and label the educator data
educator_q4 <- educator_cleaned %>%
  select(all_of(q4_vars)) %>%
  mutate(group = "Educator")

# Subset and label the employer data
employer_q4 <- employer_cleaned %>%
  select(all_of(q4_vars)) %>%
  mutate(group = "Employer")

# Combine datasets
combined_data <- bind_rows(educator_q4, employer_q4)

```



Run Mann-Whitney U Test
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)

# Pivot data to long format
q4_long <- combined_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("Q04_"),
    names_to = "Skill",
    values_to = "Rating_num"
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Rating_num))

#Must coerce character to numeric explicitly because removing na values is not enough so redo and see if it works
q4_long <- q4_long %>%
  mutate(Rating_num = as.numeric(Rating_num))

str(q4_long)

# Run Mann-Whitney U test for each skill
mw_results <- q4_long %>%
  filter(!is.na(Rating_num)) %>%  # Exclude rows with NA ratings because there is NA values hindering it from being able to run 
  group_by(Skill) %>%
  summarise(
    p_value = wilcox.test(Rating_num ~ group)$p.value,
    median_educator = median(Rating_num[group == "Educator"]),
    median_employer = median(Rating_num[group == "Employer"]),
    n_educator = sum(group == "Educator"),
    n_employer = sum(group == "Employer"),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(p_value)

print(mw_results)
   

```
We used the Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric method appropriate for comparing ordinal ratings between two independent groups. Ratings ranged from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 4 (Strongly Agree) regarding new graduate competence for each skill.

Results:

For most dental skills, the differences in ratings between educators and practice owners were not statistically significant (p-values well above 0.05), indicating that both groups generally agree on the competency level of new graduates. The skill ‚Äúinterpreting dental radiographs‚Äù (dental X-rays) showed the closest difference with a p-value of 0.064. Although this is just above the conventional 0.05 threshold, it suggests a trend where practice owners were slightly more confident in new graduates‚Äô abilities compared to educators. Median ratings for this skill were equal (3 out of 4), reinforcing that the difference is subtle.

Interpretation: There is no strong evidence that educators and practice owners disagree on the preparedness of new graduates for dental tasks. Both groups mostly agree on which skills new graduates can perform competently from day one. The only exception might be interpreting dental X-rays, where practice owners seem a little more optimistic about new grads' skills ‚Äî but this difference isn‚Äôt strong enough to be sure it‚Äôs real. The near-significant difference in confidence regarding interpreting dental X-rays may warrant further investigation but should be interpreted cautiously.


 






Is there a difference between educators and practice owners in their reports (educators‚Äô actual teaching vs. owners‚Äô perceptions) of which dental skills were taught in the pre-clinical DVM curriculum for recent graduates?

Employer Q16: ‚ÄúWhat format of instruction in dentistry does your DVM program provide during the clinical year?‚Äù (select all that apply)

Educator Q12: ‚ÄúWhich of the following skills are taught as part of the pre-clinical dentistry courses in your DVM program?‚Äù (select all that apply)
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# 1. Educator Q12 data (Q12_01 to Q12_07)
educator_q12 <- Educator_Data_Clean %>%
  select(Q12_01:Q12_07) %>%
  mutate(group = "Educator")

colnames(educator_q12)[1:7] <- paste0("Q12_", sprintf("%02d", 1:7))

# 2. Employer Q16 data (only Q16_01 to Q16_10)
employer_q16 <- Employer_Data_Clean %>%
  select(Q16_01:Q16_10) %>%  # select only first 10 Q16 columns
  mutate(group = "Employer")

colnames(employer_q16)[1:10] <- paste0("Q16_", sprintf("%02d", 1:10))

# 3. Combine datasets
combined_raw <- bind_rows(educator_q12, employer_q16)

# 4. Convert Q columns to character to avoid pivot issues
combined_raw_clean <- combined_raw %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("Q"), as.character))

# 5. Pivot longer
combined_long <- combined_raw_clean %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("Q"),
    names_to = "Skill_Format",
    values_to = "Taught_raw"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Taught = na_if(Taught_raw, "N/A"),
    Taught = na_if(Taught, ""),
    Taught = as.numeric(Taught)
  ) %>%
  select(Skill_Format, group, Taught)

# 6. Confirm columns included
combined_long %>%
  filter(grepl("^Q16_", Skill_Format)) %>%
  distinct(Skill_Format)




combined_long %>%
  filter(grepl("^Q16_", Skill_Format)) %>%
  group_by(Skill_Format) %>%
  summarise(
    total_responses = n(),
    missing = sum(is.na(Taught)),
    non_missing = total_responses - missing,
    prop_non_missing = non_missing / total_responses
  )


```

During the analysis of the combined dataset comparing educators‚Äô reports and practice owners‚Äô perceptions of which dental skills are taught in the pre-clinical DVM curriculum, we encountered a data quality issue with the survey item labeled Q12_11. Specifically, all responses for this skill were recorded as missing values (NAs) across both groups‚Äîeducators and employers. Because there were no actual observed responses for this item, the contingency table used for statistical testing contained no valid data points. Removing Q12_11 allows us to focus on skills where sufficient data exist to reliably assess differences in perceptions about curriculum content between educators and practice owners.

Another item worth pointing out is that the Q16 fields (Q16_01 to Q16_10), out of 43 total responses, approximately 70% are missing, with only about 30% of responses containing usable data. This high level of missingness may limit the robustness of any analysis on these items and should be carefully considered when interpreting results. Further investigation into the reasons for missing data is recommended before proceeding.







Another key item to keep in mind as to why the code above won't work is that the key issue is that the Educator survey uses Q12 questions, while the Employer survey uses Q16 questions for related skills. As a result, the Educator group only has data for Q12 items, and the Employer group only has data for Q16 items. Because the question labels differ, no single skill label contains responses from both groups, preventing valid 2√ó2 contingency tables needed for Fisher‚Äôs exact tests. To compare the two groups on the same skills, we rename Employer Q16 columns to match the Q12 labels. This alignment allows us to combine data by common skill labels, ensuring each skill includes responses from both groups and enabling meaningful statistical comparisons.

The Fisher‚Äôs exact test results show no statistically significant differences between Educators and Employers across all seven skills assessed (all p-values > 0.32). Both groups reported similar proportions of positive responses, with Educator positive response rates ranging from about 53% to 77%, and Employer rates ranging from about 54% to 92%. These findings suggest that Educators and Employers have broadly comparable perceptions or reports regarding training or expectation of these veterinary dentistry skills. The lack of significant difference implies alignment between the two groups on these specific competencies.






To assess whether educators and employers differ in their beliefs about which dental skills should be included in the pre-clinical DVM curriculum, we analyzed responses to parallel Likert-scale questions: Q13 (educators) and Q17 (employers). Both groups rated the importance of teaching 12 specific dentistry skills using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 4 (Strongly Agree). Because the data were ordinal and responses came from two independent groups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare educator and employer ratings for each skill individually.

The results showed statistically significant differences in opinion for two of the twelve skills. Employers were significantly more likely than educators to agree that feline open extractions involving multiple roots or canines (Skill_11, p = 0.003) and fluoride treatment (Skill_12, p = 0.013) should be included in the pre-clinical curriculum. For all other skills, there were no statistically significant differences between groups (all p > 0.10), and the median rating for most skills was 4 (‚ÄúStrongly Agree‚Äù) in both groups. These findings suggest general alignment between educators and employers on most skills, but highlight a few areas‚Äîparticularly more advanced feline extractions and fluoride use‚Äîwhere employer expectations may exceed what educators currently prioritize for pre-clinical training.

To assess whether educators and practice owners differ in their expectations for the number of dental procedures students should complete during clinical training, we compared responses from Question 19 of the educator survey and Question 24 of the employer survey. Respondents reported the number of procedures they believe should be completed across four clinical settings: primary care, dentistry rotations, shelter medicine, and lab animal medicine. Since Shapiro-Wilk tests indicated that the data were not normally distributed in any group-setting combination (all p-values < 0.05), we used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare groups for each setting.

The results showed no statistically significant differences in expectations between educators and employers across all four settings (all p-values > 0.09). However, there were modest differences in median values. For example, in dentistry rotations, employers reported a higher median (6.5 procedures) than educators (4 procedures), though the p-value (0.098) did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, both groups reported low or zero median expectations for procedures in lab animal and shelter medicine settings. These findings suggest general alignment between groups, though some settings‚Äîparticularly dentistry rotations‚Äîmay reflect subtle differences in expectations that warrant further exploration.
